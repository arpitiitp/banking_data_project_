Banking Dataset

Term deposits serve as a significant revenue stream for banks, representing cash investments held within financial institutions. These investments involve committing funds for a predetermined period, during which they accrue interest at an agreed-upon rate. To promote term deposits, banks employ various outreach strategies including email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing.

Despite the advent of digital channels, telephonic marketing campaigns persist as one of the most effective means of engaging customers. However, they necessitate substantial investment due to the requirement of large call centers to execute these campaigns. Therefore, it becomes essential to pre-identify potential customers likely to convert, enabling targeted outreach efforts via phone calls.
